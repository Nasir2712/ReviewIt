# ReviewIt

This application is a product review system built in MeteorJS Framework. A user can only read reviews before logging in. After the user has
logged in it can add reviews and also add a product for other users to leave a review. The user can also add in product information and also give a rating from 1-5.
The average rating and the number of reviews is then displayed with the product.

Front-End is using bootstrap and back-end is mongo collections.

This project was made in A100 to stretch my meteor skills further.
